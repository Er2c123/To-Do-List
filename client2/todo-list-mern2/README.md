## Fully Functional To-Do List App Showing How to Create a MERN App 



This project was designed for me to gain experience on the MERN framework and to be used by anyone as a form of organization. It contains the following:
* A responsive website that allows users to create an account, login to account, change account password, and add,
delete, and edit to-do items
*A frontend built using React and JavaScript and backend API built using Node.js and Express
* Stores users and their respective to-do items in MongoDB database
* Uses Bcrypt to encrypt and securely store user passwords on MongoDB database

## How to Install This Project

1. clone project
2. npm install all dependencies
3. Inside server.js, change the MongoDB connection to your own account. Add in your own secret key for JWT_SECRET.
